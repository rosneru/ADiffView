## uml: sequence diagram
Here I will embed PlantUML markup to generate a sequence diagram.

I can include as many plantuml segments as I want in my Markdown, and the diagrams can be of any type supported by PlantUML.

```plantuml
@startuml
Bob -> Alice: Hello
[User interface]
[DiffEngine]
() Hallo
@enduml
```
