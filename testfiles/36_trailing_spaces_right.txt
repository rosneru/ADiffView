2.1 (xx.xx.xxxx)
- Added support for multiple menu item selection	
- Now prevent the start of the comparison if the same filename is
  selected for the left and right file (only string comparison of the
  filename)
- Fixed a problem where window titles were damaged after comparing files	
  with no differences	
- Fixed a MuForce hit when navigate to last diff was called

2.0 (27.07.2021)
- Added new color icon in AmigaOS3.2 style - many thanks to Mason!
- Rendering: Added tabulator support, defaults to 8 spaces for each tab.
  Can be configured with the (ToolType / CLI) argument TABSIZE.
- Navigation: Added a text search function.
- Navigation: Added more commands to navigate between diff blocks. 
- Layout: Improved the progress window layout.
- Behavior: Removed the (ToolType / CLI) argument ASKONWORKBENCH. 
  An AppIcon is used instead but only available when ADiffView is 
  started from the Workbench. Double clicking on the AppIcon brings 
  ADiffView to front. When files are dropped on the AppIcon, their 
  names are inserted into the open files window on an empty file name 
  gadget. The AppIcon can be disabled with the ToolType NOAPPICON.
- Performance: Improved the reading of input files. Now each file is 
  read as a whole and no unnecessary string copying is done anymore.
- Development: Widely changed the internal application structure.
  Now using C++ exceptions and some basic STL - cleaner code and more 
  coding fun for me. But this comes at a cost. The binary size increased
  from about 70k to 190k even before new features were implemented. 
  The use of exceptions also drops MC68000 compatibility, so at least 
  a 68020 CPU is needed now.

1.2 (01.01.2020)	
- Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.1 which produced Enforcer hits in 	
  progress window.	
- Fixed problem in text rendering where some lines were displayed 	
  intermeshed.	
- The Line numbers of the source files are now displayed in diff result.	
- Added the (ToolType / CLI) argument NOLINENUMBERS to turn of the	
  display of the line numbers.	

1.1 (22.12.2019)
- Now using the Myers diff algorithm for better results.
- File select window: When a file was selected with the file request, 
  the request for the other file opens in the same directory.
- File select window: Keyboard shortcuts are now working.
- File select window: Added a feature to swap left and right file.
- File select window: Added support for Drag'n drop. If the program 
  runs on Workbench you can drag the files to compare into that window.
- Diff result window: Added a feature to navigate to next / previous 
  difference.
- Now OS3.0+ memory pools are used. Speeds up the freeing of memory. 
  There's a noticeable speed improvement on exit after big files have 
  been compared.

1.0.1 (13.03.2019)
- Fixed a bug which caused a crash when comparing long files
- Fixed a minor problem in the about window where the title was always 
  inherited by the parent window.
- Added some more info into the manual chapter about ADiffView and 
  Directory Opus

1.0.0 (21.02.2019)
